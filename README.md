### üñ•Ô∏è Data Sources

The data is constructed from scrapped news from Google News feed, as well as Reddit posts as comments. I used both `rss scraping` and `Playwright` to gather the data.  
All the stock information has been taken from the `yfinance` library, and the indicators were created using `TA-LIB`.  
For the sentiment model, I used a pre-trained model and fine-tuned it using Hugging Face. The training process is fully documented in the notebook.
